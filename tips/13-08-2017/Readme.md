Today I will only left 2 links for you:

- [BB is watching you: demo][1]
- [BB is watching you: explanation][2]

Steps to do on a demo page:  
1. Type any input and press **save**  
2. Open the same page in incognito mode  
3. Be surprised  

**The principles**

The demo was created using a fingerprintjs library. It identifies a user by calculating a hash of a bunch of unique parameters:

- UserAgent
- Language settings
- TimeZone
- Plugins list
- Installed fonts (the most significant part)

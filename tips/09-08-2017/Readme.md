Today we will overview the differences between open-source licenses: MIT, Apache and GPL.

First of all, MIT, Apache and GPL licenses are **all permissive licenses**, meaning: you are free to do whatever you want with a software.

They differ a bit though:

- **MIT**: "Do whatever you want, even if you want to use the code to create a commercial closed-source software. Though if you start contributing back, it will be nice."
- **Apache**: "Do whatever you want, like with the MIT license. Still, I will prevent any attempt of creating a patent on the software or litigating"
- **GPL**: "Do whatever you want, but remember: I'm share-alike. Once you use the code you are to share your software with the same license"

Thus, a specific license signifies our concern about the code:
- **MIT** - we actually don't bother
- **Apache** - we don't bother too, but we are big enough (e.g. an organization) to think about preventing litigations
- **GPL** - we want you to open-source too

> Note: ISC (npm's default license) is very similar to MIT

Recently I've started learning about JS **V8**'s internals. [Mathias Bynens][1], a **V8** contributor from Google, wrote an interesting article named [“Elements kinds” in V8][2]. He explains how JS engines usually deal with numeric properties and which patterns not to use in order to avoid performance penalty.

The general ideas are quite clear:
- Prefer *dense* arrays to *sparse*
- Prefer to fill an array with data all of the same type
- Prefer *integers* to *double* to *mixed* types
- For array creation prefer `[1]` to `x = new Array(3); x[0] = 0`

While the above unveils some information on how to write more performant code, it's still leaves a lot of ambiguities. To make things clear [Mathias][1] shows the example of debugging generated code using **d8 REPL**.

##### Building **V8** from sources

If you are on Linux/Mac I'd suggest you follow [a straightforward installation][3] process described at **V8** wiki. If you are on Windows I'd suggest you first install Docker and then follow the same installation process.

> Note: Fetching V8 took me ~10 minutes. Building it from sources took ~30 minutes. During fetch there is no any status bar so you might think something got wrong. Be patient.

I was using the following commands set:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir .v8
cd .v8
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
echo export PATH=`pwd`/depot_tools:"\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc # or ~/.zshrc
source ~/.bashrc
gclient
fetch v8
cd v8
gclient sync
tools/dev/v8gen.py x64.debug
ninja -C out.gn/x64.debug
```

That's it. At this point we have a **d8 REPL** with a wide set of [special functions][4]:

```bash
> out.gn/x64.debug/d8 --allow-natives-syntax

V8 version 6.3.0 (candidate)

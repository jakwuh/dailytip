In [the previous tip][1] we have mentioned a rule from [Angular Style Guide][2]:

- Do place private members after public members, **alphabetized**.

WebStorm (as well as other JetBrains IDEA's) has an automatic code arrangement feature. Look at the demo:

![Rearrange code](./rearrange.gif)

To start using it you need to do a few simple steps:

1) Set up the **Arrangement** settings as shown at the screenshot below

![Arrangement settings](./settings.png)

2) Press `cmd (ctrl)` + `shift` + `a` and choose **Rearrange Code**

Whoa! Looking back and seeing all the big job we've done together inspires me a lot. Sure, together - because **100** tips written day-by-day can't be possible without your support, my readers. I'm truly happy for that.

Back then, at [**50th**][1] tip I've described all those aims I've set myself. There are:

##### Form the character (e.v.e.r.y. d.a.m.n. d.a.y.)

There is a ["21 days" myth][2] saying that 21 days of task completion forms a habit. I am not aware of truthfulness of it, but could say doing something more than 50 times sequentially definitely forms a habit. Thus saying, writing tips became less stressful for me after some critical point: regardless of time being left - I was sure I would do it.

##### Learn English

I do become feeling myself more confident when I write text in English. Each day I wrote a tip made me asking less and less questions about its correctness.

##### Force myself to get a new knowledge everyday

Not only I share new knowledge with you, but also learn. There are a lot of "side effects" of doing that: learning algorithms, implementing some concepts in my job projects, following news and a lot more.

##### Help / mentor people

Same as I wrote 50 tips before, people reading tips, discussing problems, finding mistakes or just saying *Thank you* are the best motivation for leading such a project.

### What's next?

I am restructuring the project to match new aims and expectations. Lets introspect the old and the new.

What remains the same:
- The project is alive and is going to
- Tips are only on important topics - I appreciate your time
- "IMO" is implied

What is changing:

- `Daily Tip` is renamed to `Web Tip`
- Tips become bigger, deeper and on more complicated things
- Tips will have a short description which will be posted to Telegram as well
- Tips will not be posted on a daily basis

I believe the new project structure will play a good game and make it even more interesting and spectacular.

Thank you for your time and see you soon!

Now I'm reading [Getting Real][1] - a book about building successful web apps from Basecamp (former [37signals][2]). While I disagree with a number of thoughts discussed (e.g. the advice to start coding having only core system principles and aims rather than having a detailed look at it), there are still a plenty of highly useful pieces of advice. Actually there are a lot of headlines in the book:

- Build less
- Build software for yourself
- Fund Yourself
- Fix Time and Budget, Flex Scope
- Have an Enemy
- Lower Your Cost of Change
- Embrace Constraints
- Ignore Details Early On
- Scale Later

\- and they all convince us in pretty much the same idea - be precise in what you build. That involves a lot of things to remember about. First of all - no matter you are a developer or a PM - you should have a strong vision of what you do. Having it will help making right decisions throughout the project. Second, it's better to embrace constraints and build software in such a way that you will be in time with deadlines. Try to avoid estimating long milestones - because there are a lot of reasons why these estimates will fail. Instead of having long 6-weeks project split it down by 6 1-week projects with more precise estimates and cleaner scope. And lastly, avoid everything that is not essential: premature optimisations and scaling, preferences and low priority features. It is definitely better to build less but launch earlier. Once again, no matter you are a developer or a PM or a business owner.

Have a look at [Getting Real][1] book for more explanations and live examples.
